# Teamspeak in qemu

Set up a container with qemu installed that can run the teamspeak binary.

It is using the same entrypoint as the official container from https://hub.docker.com/_/teamspeak,
but is using a `Debian` as a baseimage for using `qemu`.

## Problem

The binary right now periodically `SEGFAULTS` with a `BUSERROR`.
